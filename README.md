# Cargo Connect

Cargo Connect revolutionizes freight management by addressing key industry challenges. Our platform streamlines sourcing, truck selection, and addresses logistics and transactional issues, making it easier for users to book trucks. Users can directly contact truck owners based on their freight needs, delivery dates, pickup, and delivery points. Additionally, truck drivers can create accounts, establishing a direct connection between users and truck owners, eliminating costs and issues associated with middlemen.
